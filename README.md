This repository investigates methods of spatial graph convolutions for 3D Shape classification and Point cloud semantic segmentation. 

Academic datasets such as ModelNet10 and S3DIS are included as well as my own datasets. 

My own datasets come from 
1. BIM (Building Information Modelling) for classification tasks
2. Pointclouds scanned with NavVis M6 Scanners
